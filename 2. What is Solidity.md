Get introduced to the Solidity programming language. Its features and its history.

## ðŸ‘€What is Solidity?

Gavin Wood proposed Solidity in 2004. Ethereum project's contributors' team developed Solidity, which Christian Reitwiessner led. 
Christian Reitwiessner's team released Solidity officially in March 2018.

Solidity is an Object-Oriented programming language used to implement and design smart contracts on blockchain platforms. 
Solidity was inspired and shaped by C++, Python, and Javascript programming languages. Solidity was created primarily to execute smart contracts.

Ethereum blockchain is implemented using Solidity, a widely used blockchain where Solidity is designed to run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

Like all other programming languages, Solidity has variables, data types, loops, functions, classes, objects, mathematical operations, 
and many other concepts, which we will discuss in upcoming lessons.

## ðŸ‘€Why use Solidity?

We can use the Solidity programming language for various purposes. Some of them are:
* Dapps: Dapps are the apps used to run on Solidity. Dapps exist on the Ethereum blockchain, but Solidity helps them in execution.
* Smart Contracts: We build Dapps by combining multiple pieces of code, called smart contracts. The programming language used to write smart contracts is Solidity.
* Tokens: Developers can create their tokens, and Solidiy helps them create one.

## ðŸ‘€Solidity Features

Solidity has the following key features:
* Solidity supports libraries, inheritance, and complex user-defined types.
* Solidity is a statically typed language.
* It is an Object-Oriented programming language.
* Solidity is an open-source programming language.
* Solidity runs on Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
