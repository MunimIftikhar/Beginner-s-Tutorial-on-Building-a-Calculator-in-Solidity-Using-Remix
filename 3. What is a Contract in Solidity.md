# What is a Contract in Solidity?
Get an understanding of contracts in Solidity. What are they, how are they structured, and how can they be implemented? 

## What is a contract in Solidity?
Solidity contracts work like a class in any object-oriented programming language, e.g., Java and C++. 
A contract has the following properties, just like classes:
* Constructor
* Variables
* Functions

## Contract syntax

Let's look at the basic syntax of a contract in Solidity:

```Solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract example {
  // Variables declaration
  // Constructor declaration
  // Functions declaration
}
```

### Pragma

The pragma works like an identifier that identifies the code written in Solidity.
Pragma helps prevent the breakage for future newer versions. It helps specify the version and load functionalities accordingly.
Pragma also tells the compiler how to run the code. Each Solidity source code should start with the `pragma version` line.

### Contract keyword
The `contract` keyword helps declare the contract in Solidity that enclose the code: constructor, variables, and functions.
